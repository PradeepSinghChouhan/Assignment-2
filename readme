# Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This Python program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

## ðŸ“œ Description

The program performs the following steps:
1. Initializes a variable to store the "a".
2. Uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
3. Adds each number to the total sum using the `+=` operator.
4. Prints the final result.

## ðŸ§® Code

```python
# Initialize sum to 0
a = 0

# Iterate from 1 to 50 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 51):
    a += i  # Add each number to the sum

# Display the final sum
print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:", a)
